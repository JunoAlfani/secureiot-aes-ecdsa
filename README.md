# secureiot-aes-ecdsa
This system implements AES and ECDSA cryptography methods to mitigate Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on IoT-based systems. The AES algorithm is used to maintain data confidentiality during transmission, while ECDSA plays a role in authentication and data integrity verification.
